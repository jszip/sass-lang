Sass-lang
==================

What is it?
-----------

An Apache Maven based Gem to JAR repackaging of the [Sass gem file](http://sass-lang.com). 

The original work was by [Dmitry Erman](https://github.com/dmitrye/sass-gems) and used part of the 
[technique posted by Nick Sieger](http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2009/01/10/jruby-1-1-6-gems-in-a-jar) 
but [packaged into a Maven build](http://pastebin.com/KPeZ8mpG).

The goal is to make the sass-lang gem available as a jar in the central Maven repository. 

The primary driver for these releases is the needs of the 
[jszip-maven-plugin](http://jszip.org/jszip-maven-plugin)
